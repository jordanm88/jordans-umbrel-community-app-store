  qBittorrent is an open-source software alternative to ÂµTorrent. It's designed to meet the needs of most users while using as little CPU and memory as possible.


  This version of qBittorrent uses the linuxserver.io image, so it doesn't have integration with other umbrel apps! 
  This app comes bundled with VueTorrent. To enable it, navigate to tools --> options --> Web UI and select "Use alternative Web UI". In the "Files location" field, enter "/app/vuetorrent" and then click "Save".
