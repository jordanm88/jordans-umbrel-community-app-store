  Get the gold standard for browsing with speed, privacy and control.
  
  Seriously private browsing. Firefox automatically blocks 2000+ online trackers from collecting information about what you do online.
  No shady privacy policies or back doors for advertisers. Just a lightning fast browser that doesn’t sell you out.
