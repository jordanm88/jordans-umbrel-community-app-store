releaseNotes: >-
  If you encounter any issues, please report them on the issues page.

  This release is just a small patch to fix a really annoying issue with extension popups not working correctly.

  Fixes:
    - Fixed compact mode staying open when toggling while having a popup open
    - Fixed extension popups not multiplying their height every time they are opened

  Breaking Changes:
    - Disabled firefox's login manager by default, because safer alternatives are available. Can be enabled again in the preferences
